# Functional Measurement of Dynamical Robustness in Networks of RNNs

Author: Joel Ye

Course project for Network Science Class. How do RNN graph networks continue to compute when nodes are noised during computation?

Model is based off of [`pytorch-geometric`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
